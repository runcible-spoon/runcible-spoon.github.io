## Technolutions

Here's a representative sample of the work I've done documenting the customer relationship manager Slate for my current company, Technolutions. 

### Portal Components

- [Portal Components](https://knowledge.technolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/16516391511579)

Components let you create design elements with a locked-down range of configuration. 

They used to be unique to Deliver, the communications tool in Slate, and as part of the Slate Summit 2023 feature release, their capabilities were extended to portals (microsites you can build in Slate). 

This article details:

- What components are
- What they can do
- How you can use them in portals

### Custom Datasets

- [Custom Datasets](https://knowledge.technolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033050652-Creating-a-Custom-Dataset)

I break down a complicated Slate process: creating a dataset. 

A dataset is a recreation of the default person record data structure. To build one of their own, users need to touch many different tools in many different locations. 

I give them a playbook at the top, and keep information streamlined and compartmentalized. 

### Badge Printing

- [Badge Printing](https://knowledge.technolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/9191589346331)

Slate lets you host events, and it lets you print attendee badges on demand for those events. This article walks you through:

- How it works
- The equipment and software you'll need to have
- How to print an attendee badge
