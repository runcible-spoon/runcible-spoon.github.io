## Technolutions

Here's a representative sample of the work I've done documenting the customer relationship manager Slate for my current company, Technolutions. 

### Person Record Matching Criteria

- [Person Record Matching Criteria](https://knowledge.technolutions.net/docs/matching-criteria-for-person-records)

The overall process that Slate takes to match a new person record coming into the database to existing ones is complicated. After consulting an engineer on the particulars, I added several graphics to this article to make the reader's experience of this process more intuitive. 

### Portal Components

- [Portal Components](https://knowledge.technolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/16516391511579)

Components let you create design elements with a locked-down range of configuration. 

They used to be unique to Deliver, the communications tool in Slate, and as part of the Slate Summit 2023 feature release, their capabilities were extended to portals (microsites you can build in Slate). 

This article details:

- What components are
- What they can do
- How you can use them in portals


### Custom Datasets

- [Datasets Overview](https://knowledge.technolutions.net/v1/docs/en/datasets-overview)

A dataset is a recreation of the default person record data structure. Users can build datasets of their own, a process which touches many different tools in many different locations.

I created an overview video to demystify the purpose and workings of datasets. I also reconfigured this article to serve as a roadmap for the dataset section.
