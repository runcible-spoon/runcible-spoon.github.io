## Technolutions

Here's a representative sample of the work I've done documenting the higher-ed customer relationship management software Slate.
- [AI Dashboards](https://knowledge.technolutions.net/docs/ai-dashboards): Teaches users how they can use a combination of querying and natural language to generate a dashboard on a record.
- [Person Record Matching Criteria](https://knowledge.technolutions.net/docs/matching-criteria-for-person-records): The overall process that Slate takes to match a new person record coming into the database to existing ones is complicated. After consulting an engineer on the particulars, I added several graphics to this article to make the reader's experience of this process more intuitive.
- [The Case Tag](https://knowledge.technolutions.net/docs/case-tags-in-liquid-markup): Slate can leverage Liquid markup to render communications and other content dynamically. Here, I break down the case tag in a way that's digestible to readers who may have limited web design experience.
