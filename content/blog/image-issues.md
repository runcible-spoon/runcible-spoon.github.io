## Image issues

Have been having a hell of a time getting images to load. Can't determine whether this is because:

- The site isn't published and I'm running it locally (not likely)
- The theme is preventing image-calling shortcode from being executed.
- Theme documentation also doesn't mention anything about images (shows an example, but I can only see the HTML)

Now, I can't even get a PDF to load. Going to publish to GitHub Pages in the hopes that that fixes the issue.
