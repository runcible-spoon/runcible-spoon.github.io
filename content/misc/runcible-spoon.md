## What's a runcible spoon?

"Runcible spoon" comes from an Edward Lear poem and had no inherent meaning when he wrote it:

>They dined on mince and slices of quince, 
>which they ate with a runcible spoon.

Over time the term came to mean "spork." 

I first saw "runcible spoon" in Thomas Pynchon's *Gravity's Rainbow*, where, immediately following World War II, two US seamen engage in a makeshift knifefight with the implements to pass the time. 

I liked the way it sounded and made it my Github handle. This site is served by Github Pages, which by default places your username in the URL. You can [view the repo here](https://github.com/runcible-spoon/runcible-spoon.github.io).
